        "question": "What is a Japanese verb conjugator?",
        "answer": "A Japanese verb conjugator is a tool that transforms Japanese verbs from their dictionary form into various grammatical forms such as past tense, negative, potential, passive, and more. Our free conjugator handles all verb types including Godan (u-verbs), Ichidan (ru-verbs), and irregular verbs like する and 来る."

        "answer": "Enter any Japanese verb in its dictionary form (the form ending in -u) into our conjugator. The tool will automatically detect the verb type and generate all conjugation forms including te-form, masu-form, potential, passive, causative, conditional, and more."
      },
      {
        "question": "What are Godan verbs (u-verbs)?",
        "answer": "Godan verbs, also called u-verbs or Group 1 verbs, are Japanese verbs that conjugate across five vowel sounds (a, i, u, e, o). They end in various consonant + u combinations like -ku, -gu, -su, -tsu, -nu, -bu, -mu, -ru, or just -u. Examples include 書く (kaku - to write), 読む (yomu - to read), and 話す (hanasu - to speak)."
      },
      {
        "question": "What are Ichidan verbs (ru-verbs)?",
        "answer": "Ichidan verbs, also called ru-verbs or Group 2 verbs, are Japanese verbs that end in -iru or -eru. They conjugate by simply dropping the final る and adding the appropriate ending. Examples include 食べる (taberu - to eat), 見る (miru - to see), and 起きる (okiru - to wake up)."
      },
      {
        "question": "What are irregular Japanese verbs?",
        "answer": "Japanese has only two truly irregular verbs: する (suru - to do) and 来る (kuru - to come). Additionally, ある (aru - to exist) has an irregular negative form (ない instead of あらない), and 行く (iku - to go) has an irregular te-form (行って instead of 行いて). Our conjugator handles all these exceptions correctly."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is the te-form in Japanese?",
        "answer": "The te-form (て形) is a connective verb form used for making requests, expressing continuous actions (te-iru), connecting sentences, and forming compound verbs. For Godan verbs, the te-form involves sound changes based on the verb ending. For Ichidan verbs, simply replace る with て."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is the masu-form in Japanese?",
        "answer": "The masu-form (ます形) is the polite form of Japanese verbs used in formal situations. It is formed by adding ます to the verb stem. For Godan verbs, change the final -u sound to -i and add ます. For Ichidan verbs, drop る and add ます."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is the potential form in Japanese?",
        "answer": "The potential form expresses ability or possibility (\"can do\"). For Godan verbs, change the final -u to -eru. For Ichidan verbs, there are two forms: traditional (-rareru) and colloquial (-reru). Our conjugator shows both forms for Ichidan verbs."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is the passive form in Japanese?",
        "answer": "The passive form (受身形) indicates that the subject receives an action. For Godan verbs, change the final -u to -areru. For Ichidan verbs, drop る and add られる. The passive can also express suffering or adversity in Japanese."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is the causative form in Japanese?",
        "answer": "The causative form (使役形) expresses making or letting someone do something. For Godan verbs, change the final -u to -aseru. For Ichidan verbs, drop る and add させる. This form is essential for expressing permission or coercion."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is this Japanese verb conjugator free?",
        "answer": "Yes! Our Japanese verb conjugator is completely free to use with no registration required. You can conjugate unlimited verbs and access all conjugation forms at no cost."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I use this conjugator for JLPT preparation?",
        "answer": "Absolutely! Understanding verb conjugation is essential for all JLPT levels. Our conjugator covers all forms tested on the JLPT, from basic masu-form (N5) to complex causative-passive forms (N3-N1). Use it alongside our Kanji and Vocabulary training for comprehensive JLPT preparation."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is the conditional form in Japanese?",
        "answer": "Japanese has several conditional forms: the ba-form (ば形) for hypothetical conditions, the tara-form (たら形) for sequential or conditional events, and the nara-form (なら形) for topical conditions. Our conjugator generates all three conditional forms."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is the volitional form in Japanese?",
        "answer": "The volitional form (意向形) expresses intention or suggestion (\"let's do\" or \"I will do\"). The plain volitional ends in -ou/-you, while the polite volitional uses ましょう. It is commonly used for making suggestions or expressing determination."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do compound verbs work in Japanese?",
        "answer": "Compound verbs combine a noun or verb stem with する (to do) or 来る (to come). Examples include 勉強する (benkyou suru - to study) and 持ってくる (motte kuru - to bring). Our conjugator correctly handles compound verbs by preserving the prefix while conjugating the する or 来る portion."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is the tai-form in Japanese?",
        "answer": "The tai-form (たい形) expresses desire or want (\"want to do\"). It is formed by adding たい to the verb stem. The tai-form conjugates like an i-adjective, so it has forms like たくない (don't want to), たかった (wanted to), and たくなかった (didn't want to)."
